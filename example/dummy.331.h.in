/* This file is the default file that gets included via
#include dummy.331.h
inside main.c

You should never see this file in running code produced bythe 331 compiler.
Instead a suitable replacement file should be created and substituted in main.c

For example if your 331 file is super.331, then main.c should have as its first line

#include super.331.h

where super.331.h is created automatically from super.331
